English is not my native language. I speak it regulary, mainly at work and with some other friend, truth is that I can still look at words and still produce in me a certain magic feeling, and that is what happened when I lookup for the meaning of Origin in the dictionary.

> Origin: a book or recording that has not been previously made available in a different form: paperback originals.
