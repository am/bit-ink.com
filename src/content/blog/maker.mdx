I've been working around to add a gallery component to this blog. There have been a while since the last time I published photos. There isn't really a common topic about the following photos, most of those are connecte to nature and the places we go often, the sea, the dunes and some beutiful flowers gardened by my wife.

import Gallery from "../../components/Gallery.astro";

<Gallery
	images={[
		{
			src: "/photos/DSC00238.jpg",
			"src-thumb": "/photos/DSC00238-thumb.jpg",
			alt: "petals of a rose",
		},
