About
-----

Aiming to write applications that scale well and merge fast with ever-changing business requirements. Currently, I'm working on hybrid mobile apps written in javascript.

Specialized in frontend development, I encourage functional and reactive programming. Having study communication design was the foundation for having autonomy and confidence while crafting great user experiences.

My hobbies have one thing in common and that is the pleasure for the craft. I like to build hardware, from mechanical keyboards to sound controllers or even my own computer.
