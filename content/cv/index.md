About
-----

Aiming to write full-stack applications that scale well and merge fast with ever-changing business requirements. Currently, I'm working on hybrid mobile apps written in javascript.

Specialized in frontend development, I encourage functional and reactive programming, and I like to delete code – less is more. Having study communication design was the foundation for having autonomy and confidence while crafting great user experiences. 

Proficiency
-----------

- Build seamless user experiences.
- Listen to clients and understand business goals.
- Language agnostic, and focused on streamlining the work processes
- Evaluate most adequate tools to improve workflows.
- Fast learner, autodidact, proactive, mentor, and easily adapted to different environments and policies.
