About
-----
I was born in the north of Portugal and lived my childhood in a small seaside city. The sea is my second home.

On the 80's I've copied 8-bit games on a Sinclair. Started the new millennium mixing live video and doing generative art with processing. I've then study arts and end up graduating on communication design while my passion for coding was arising.

Now I live in Barcelona with my beloved wife and daughter. Here I write computer programs professionally and build mechanical keyboards for fun. I do consider myself a maker:

> What hackers and painters have in common is that they're both makers. Along with composers, architects, and writers, what hackers and painters are trying to do is make good things.

> â€” Paul Graham
